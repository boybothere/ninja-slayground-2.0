Problem statement
You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'. Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.

Note:
You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(LogN)
