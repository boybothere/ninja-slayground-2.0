Problem statement
You are given two integers 'n', and 'm'.

Calculate 'gcd(n,m)', without using library functions.

Note:
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers 'n' and 'm' is the largest positive number that divides both 'n' and 'm' without leaving a remainder.

Example:
Input: 'n' = 6, 'm' = 4

Output: 2
