Problem statement
You are given a 2D matrix ‘MATRIX’ of ‘N’*’M’ dimension. You have to return the spiral traversal of the matrix.

Example:

Input:
MATRIX = [ [1, 3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 16, 20], [23, 30, 34, 60] ]
Output:
1 3 5 7 20 60 34 30 23 10 11 16

Explanation: Starting from the element in the first row and the first column, traverse from left to right (1 3 5 7), then top to bottom (20 60), then right to left (34 30 23), then bottom to up (10) and then left to right (11 16).
