Problem statement
You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers and an integer ‘x’.Implement the ‘upper bound’ function to find the index of the upper bound of 'x' in the array.

Note:
1. The upper bound in a sorted array is the index of the first value that is greater than a given value. 
2. If the greater value does not exist then the answer is 'n', Where 'n' is the size of the array.
3. Try to write a solution that runs in log(n) time complexity.

Example:

Input : ‘arr’ = {2,4,6,7} and ‘x’ = 5,

Output: 2

Explanation: The upper bound of 5 is 6 in the given array, which is at index 2 (0-indexed).
